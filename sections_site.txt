Mahendra 5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect fit, less weighty and designed well! Reviewed in India on 3 April 2023 Colour: Navy/Lime Size: 9 UK Verified Purchase Shoes are great fit for me. I moved arouned and felt very less heavier compared to my old DSC non-marking shoes. Also better compared to Nivia and Victor stuff. For 1600/-, its great deal compared to buying yonex to asics which would cost double plus. Would recommend for lawn Tennis or badminton. Good to play with beginner to intermediate players. Will probably buy another color to keep for office and casual use. Update: I brought size 2 shoe for my daughter black+gold color which also matched with her tennis kit bag of Hundred. She is super happy with shoe. I guess, I have used 4-5 hundred shoes. All great! btw any non-marking shoe on hard tennis court will last for 5-6months max. be it nike, adidas, hundred, asic. tried most of them in team. These ones are great buy for 1600/- instead of spending 7K on asics or nike. Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Report

joe A 4.0 out of 5 stars Good shoe for badminton indoor purpose Reviewed in India on 27 May 2023 Colour: Blue/White Size: 9 UK Verified Purchase i brought this shoe as secondary , 80% play i am using lining ultra 4 same size , compare between ultra 4 and this , i feel weight is almost same , ultra have more toe space due to U shape , this shoe have less toe space , so recemented to take one size up if you have big leg thumbs to avoid the pain. width is bit less compare to ultra 4 , so its will be tight and very comfortable while side way moving. product quality is good and color also very nice , grip also i feel good , comes to the insole part , its bit hard sole , but if you are using jel sole for additional support then it will not be a problem .. overall its a good product comes below 1400 rs Read more 12 people found this helpful Helpful Report

Fingerprint registering doesn't work with this screen protector. Typing, Swiping etc works.. If you find fingerprint print lock useful, please avoid this product! 1.0 out of 5 stars Very poor feet support and fitment Reviewed in India on 12 September 2025 Colour: Navy/Lime Size: 10 UK Verified Purchase I had no choice for size 10 therefore I chose not to return the shoes. I bought Nivia size 10 and that wouldn't fit me. While Reebok's shoes fits me and is reasonably comfortable (considering its not a high priced shoes), the worst two things that a player can face happens each time I play with this shoes viz. 1) the shoes comes off in the middle of the game as the back support doesn't hold my Achilles tendon 2) my feet aches badly during the game as I don't get side support for my feet. I wouldn't recommend this shoes at all. It's light weight but that doesn't help considering the above. Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Report

murshid 4.0 out of 5 stars Good Quality for the price Reviewed in India on 27 March 2024 Colour: Turquoise/Black/Grey Size: 3 UK Verified Purchase While getting the same for my daughter, was in doubt. But once saw the product in hand was impressed with the quality. I myself have used Yonex, Victor, Adidas badminton shoes and understand the same. Second, my daughter is a beginner and this is her second pair. Just after 20 min of play said the feel and comfort is very good. Even I felt an improvement in her footwork. Would really say I'm impressed by hundred and would surely try one myself soon. Read more 4 people found this helpful Helpful Report
